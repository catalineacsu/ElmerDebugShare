Elmergrid loading data:
-----------------------
Reading mesh from universal mesh file traceCapInSphere.unv.
First round for allocating data
Units dataset content is currently omitted!
Part UID = 1
Part name = SMESH_Mesh
Coord system name = Global
There are 48748 nodes in the mesh
Element type range in mesh [202,504]
Reordering 323619 elements with indexes up to 323619
Allocating mesh with 48748 nodes and 323619 4-node elements in 3 dims.
Physical index interval is [2,2]
Group index interval is [1,8]
Using offset 7 for physical indexes
Second round for reading data
Reading Coordinate system information
Reading node coordinates
Reading element topologies
Reading element groups in mode 2467
Reading 1:th group with index 1 with 13746 entities: volTrace
Element type range in group is [504 504]
Reading 2:th group with index 2 with 64379 entities: volDielectric
Element type range in group is [504 504]
Reading 3:th group with index 3 with 3564 entities: volreference
Element type range in group is [504 504]
Reading 4:th group with index 4 with 207279 entities: volAir
Element type range in group is [504 504]
Reading 5:th group with index 5 with 10992 entities: surfTrace
Element type range in group is [303 303]
Reading 6:th group with index 6 with 20250 entities: surfDielectric
Element type range in group is [303 303]
Reading 7:th group with index 7 with 5576 entities: surfReference
Element type range in group is [303 303]
Reading 8:th group with index 8 with 24212 entities: surfAir
Element type range in group is [303 303]
Moving bulk elements to boundary elements
Leading bulk elementtype is 504
Trailing bulk elementtype is 202
Checking that different dimensions have unique boundary tags!
Tag interval for boundaries: [1 9]
No overlap, no offsets needed!
There are 34650 (out of 323619) lower dimensional elements.
Node 45116 belongs to maximum of 200 elements
Found 26222 side elements that have two parents.
Found correctly 34650 side elements.
Parent elements were reordered up to index 288969.
Moved 288969 elements (out of 323619) to new positions
The Universal mesh was loaded from file traceCapInSphere.unv.

Elmergrid creating and manipulating meshes:
-------------------------------------------

Elmergrid saving data with method 2:
-------------------------------------
Saving mesh in ElmerSolver format to directory traceCapInSphere.
Reusing an existing directory
Saving 48748 coordinates to mesh.nodes.
Saving 288969 element topologies to mesh.elements.
Saving boundary elements to mesh.boundary.
Saving header info to mesh.header.
Saving names info to mesh.names.
Saving entities info to entities.sif.
